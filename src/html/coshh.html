                <p>One of the main aims of the COSHH Regulations, through a COSHH assessment,
                    is to prevent Occupational Ill health, by the identification of hazards,
                    evaluation of risks and implementation of adequate control measures.</p> 
                <p>The COSHH regulations places a duty on employers to assess the risk of
                    exposure to any substances hazardous to health to ensure that the health,
                    safety and welfare of their employees is protected.</p> 
                <blockquote><p>“COSHH Regulation 6 Assessment of the risk to health created by work involving
                    substances hazardous to health”</p></blockquote>
                    <p>states that: An employer will not carry
                    out work which is liable to expose any employees to substances hazardous
                    to health unless he has made a suitable and sufficient assessment of risk
                    and identify the steps that need to be taken to comply with these regulations.</p>
